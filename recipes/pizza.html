    <h2>Ecuadorian Pizza</h2>
    <p>Making homemade pizza dough can sound like a lot of work, but it’s so worth the bragging rights. The dough itself requires few ingredients and just a little bit of rising and rest time. While you wait for the dough to be ready, you can get to work prepping your tomato sauce, chopping fresh vegetables, or grating the cheese you’ll put on top. Bake for 15 minutes, garnish with basil (or, let’s be real, more cheese), and enjoy showing off your way-better-than-takeout creationz</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups warm watter<li>
        <li>1 teaspoon suger</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>7 cups-all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>q teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>6 tablespoon extra virgin oil </li>
        <li>28 oz canned while tomatoes</li>
        <li>30 gr cup semolina flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven as high as your oven will allow, between 450-500˚F (230-260˚C).</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the tomato sauce: Add the salt to the can of tomatoes and puree with an immersion blender, or transfer to a blender or food processor, and puree until smooth.</li>
        <li>Once the dough has rested, take a portion and start by poking the surface with your fingertips, until bubbles form and do not deflate.</li>
        <li>Then, stretch and press the dough into a thin round. Make it thinner than you think it should be, as it will slightly shrink and puff up during baking.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle semolina onto an upside down baking sheet and place the stretched crust onto it. Add the sauce and ingredients of your choice.</li>
        <li>Slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or pan. Bake for 15 minutes, or until the crust and cheese are golden brown</li>
        <li>Add any garnish of your preference.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
